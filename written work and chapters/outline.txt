Can we use topological data analysis to learn about image data? 

Topological data analysis is the method of transforming data of some description into a topological shape to analyse it. Its key insight is that data fundamentally has shape, and that shape matters. It can be used to find out information about the data that is obscured from other methods of analysis, for example hidden patterns. Moreover, a lot of data is very high dimensional, and as such is very sparse. Traditional analysis techniques rely heavily on dimensionality reduction and chosen metrics in order to say anything useful about the data, and can be sensitive to errors caused by noise. With topological data analysis, dimensionality reduction is effectively built-in, and it is insensitive to the particular metric used. It is also robust to noise, as again it is the overall shape of the data that is important.

Image data is often very high dimensional, considering that it is usually made of nxn (with n at least 10^2) pixels in 3 dimensions, sometimes with a fourth alpha dimension also. We posit that topological data analysis provides a novel way to consider this data, and learn from it. There is clear intuition in this; images are fundamentally made up of different (geometric) shapes and there is no reason this should not translate well into topology. Additionally, the high dimensionality of image data is often a problem for traditional techniques - most of the dimensions provide no useful information and do not relate to the mapping or properties of the image itself.
